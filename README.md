## Requirements

* `php` must be installed on your system
  * macOS Monterey **does not** have `php` preinstalled!
* We recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install `php`
  * To install Homebrew, follow the instructions on the "Install Homebrew" section of the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh)
  * Once you have installed Homebrew, install `php` by running `brew install php`

## Installation

1. [Download the latest version of the workflow](https://github.com/squatto/alfred-imessage-2fa/releases/latest/download/iMessage.2FA.alfredworkflow)
2. Install the workflow by double-clicking the `.alfredworkflow` file
3. You can add the workflow to a category, then click "Import" to finish importing. You'll now see the workflow listed in the left sidebar of your Workflows preferences pane.

## Configuration

* By default, only messages received in the past 15 minutes will be searched
* You can change how many minutes to look back by changing the `look_back_minutes` workflow variable
* Tutorial: [How to set workflow variables](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/variables/#environment)

![Workflow Variables](workflow-variables.png)

If your PHP installation is in a non-standard path, you can add expose it to the workflow by adding a `PATH` variable with the path to your PHP installation:

* Add a new worflow variable
* Name must be `PATH`
* Open a terminal window and run this command: `echo $PATH | pbcopy`
* Back in Alfred, paste the value value we got from the Terminal window in the Value field (it should be on your clipboard after running the previous command)
* Save the changes

## Usage

Type `2fm` to view the most recent two-factor authentication codes from iMessage messages.

Select a 2FA code and do one of the following:

* Press `<enter>` to copy it to your clipboard
* Press `⌘+<enter>` (command + enter) to copy it to your clipboard and paste it into the active app window using simulated keystrokes
  * Some websites (e.g. Wells Fargo online banking) don't support pasting a 2FA code, so this will instead simulate typing the code
  * In order for this to work, you MUST grant Alfred automation access to `System Events`. If you haven't already done so, you will be prompted to grant access. [See here for more information about Alfred automation.](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/getting-started/permissions/#automation) 
* Press `⌥+<enter>` (option + enter) to copy it to your clipboard and paste it into the active app window using the system paste (similar to pressing `⌘+V`)

## Compatibility

This workflow was developed for use with Alfred 4.
